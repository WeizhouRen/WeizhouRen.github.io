Hi, this is Weizhou who is an IT (Software Information System) student in the University of Queensland. I'm keen on travelling and photography, but I prefer programming. I'm comfortable with developing front-end and back-end. 

This is my final year in the university, and I would like to have an internship before graduating. Currently, I'm open to any suggestions from everyone, so thanks for your viewing and hope to get feedback from you.
